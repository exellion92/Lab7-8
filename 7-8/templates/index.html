        <h1 class="mt-5">Welcome to Go and Bootstrap Website!</h1>
        <p>
          This is a sample website built using both Go and Bootstrap. It
          showcases the power and versatility of these two technologies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">About Go</h2>
        <p>
          Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language created at Google.
          It is designed for efficiency, simplicity, and readability. Go has a
          strong focus on concurrent programming, making it a popular choice for
          building scalable and high-performance applications.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">About Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>
          Bootstrap is a widely-used CSS framework developed by Twitter. It
          provides a comprehensive set of responsive components and styles that
          make it easy to build modern and visually appealing websites.
          Bootstrap's grid system, typography, and pre-built components simplify
          the process of creating responsive and consistent web designs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Combining Go and Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>
          By combining Go and Bootstrap, developers can leverage the power of
          the Go programming language for server-side logic and business logic,
          while using Bootstrap for the front-end presentation and user
          interface. This combination allows for the creation of dynamic,
          interactive, and visually appealing web applications.
        </p>
